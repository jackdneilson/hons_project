	Uses of SOCMINT
		NSA / PRISM
		Statistics
		Single person identification
		Academic Work
	Current Applications
		PRISM specifics
		Security services - trend analysis

	What is facial recog
		General overview
		Why it's used
		Why theory is useful
	Uses of facial recog
		Security services
		Facebook tags
		Private security (concerts)
		Military (Afghanistan/Iraq IRIS enrolment)
	Constrained vs Unconstrained
		Constrained
		Unconstrained
		Challenges (w/o solutions, leave for later)
Theory
	Prior Work
		Seminal work (GCHQ papers)

	Individual data vs Group
		Group theory (stats, trends)
		Indivual theory (Boston bombings)
		Challenges of individual ID
		False positives / negatives rate, mitigations
	Amount of information available
		Facebook usercount
		Twitter usercount
		avg. information / profile
		Information value
		Information accuracy
	Ease of use / Accessibility
		Twitter ToS (public accessible)
		Facebook (Accessible but against ToS)
		Volume of information
		Relevancy of information
	Uses once gathered
		Stats / trends per individual
		Identification
		0-risk tracking
		Connection enumeration
		Location data
		Political / Ideological alignments
	Challenges and constraints (for individual vs government)
		Money
		Time
		Expensive computation
		Expiry date of information
		Constraints placed by social networks
		
	Prior knowledge attacks
		General description of attacks
		Prior knowledge specific (why they work, numbers for increased effectiveness)
		Attack vectors (e-mail, webpage, etc.)
		Hardened / Trained targets
	HUMINT
		Usefulness generally
		Usefulness when attacking
		Difficulty of defense
	Social Engineering
		Prior examples (mitnick)

		Standalone attacks
		Attacks bolstered by SocEng
		Effectiveness rates (hard/soft targets)
	Spearphish
		Specifics
		Why e-mail
		Why it works
		Effectiveness rates (hard/soft targets)
